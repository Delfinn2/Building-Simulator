# Building Simulator

My second upload known as Building Simulator is a game that I created 2 years ago (November of 2020) with unity.
It was my dream to create a game like this, so i created it and now (2 years after) I uploaded to GitHub!

If you want to play the game, download the zip, right click the file and click "Extract Here" (you have to install WinRAR to do that https://www.win-rar.com), when it finishes click the folder and click the exe.

To quit the game you should press esc to click close.

I hope to enjoy this game guys.
